# Zaplab Design

Flutter UI package with: 
* All the basics widgets devs expect (Buttons, Text, Checkboxes, Toasts, Modals, ...)
* Tons of Nostr-specific widgets, going from very simple (Icon Font, Emoji, ...) to very complete (Zap modals, Text editors, Chat screens, ...)

Built to play nice with:
* Android & Desktop (Web and iOS work, but get less attention)
* Any router, provider and Nostr dev kit solution 

## Unique to Zaplab Design
- zap modal
- swipe actions anywhere
- visual secret key generation
- innovative navigation

## Tailored to Nostr
[x] custom emoji (for Nostr content types and more)
[x] custom icon font 

## Docs

Documentation is in the works.
